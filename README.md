The recent COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered various aspects of life, including social distancing, economic uncertainties, and shifts in daily routines. Our group decided to see how these changes would affect details within crime, particularly in the Los Angeles area.

Our aim is to learn what was influenced, such as if crime count has changed over the years, certain crimes increased or decreased, were specific areas more affected than other, or if victims of a certain race were more targeted, in order to potentially relate these to socioeconomic factors, racism, and policies.
